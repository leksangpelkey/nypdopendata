Pandas Data Science project 3

nypd open data


In this project I am using python Pandas Libraries to analyze. The data contains hundreds of thousands of arrest records of new york city, broken down by Borough, perpetractor age group,level of offenses, perpetrator sex,etc.
I started cleaning the data by droping Nan values from DataFrame, removing the rows based on condition, change the type of column to_numeric.
Once i have cleaned up the data a bit, i moved the data exploration section. In this section i explore the data in regards to different Borough like:

In which month highest offenses was committed?

What are the top 5 offenses? 

What are level of offenses committed monthly?

Which gender commits the most offenses?

Which age group commits the highest offenses?

To answer these question i have walk through calling different libraries like pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. They include:

adding column

using groupby to perform aggregate analysis

using condition function to select data bases on conditions

plottng bar charts, piechart and using seaborn to visualize my results
